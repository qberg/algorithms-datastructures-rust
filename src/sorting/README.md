# Sorting algorithms

## Problem definiton

**Input:** Sequence $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, ..., a_{n}\right)$

**Output:** Permutation $\left(a_{1}^{'}, a_{2}^{'},...,a_{n}^{'}\right)$ such that $a_{1}^{'} \leq a_{2}^{'} \leq ...\leq a_{n}^{'}$

## Insertion sort

Analogous to how one sorts a hand of cards by starting with an empty left hand and cards face down on a table. Then we remove one card at a time form the table and insert it in to the correct position in the hand. It is an *inplace* sorting algorithm and is *stable*.

* Worst-case: $O(n^{2})$, when the array is reverse sorted.
